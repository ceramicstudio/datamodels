# Social Connection DataModel

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D @datamodels/social-connection
```

## Rationale

People are getting tired of registering and re-declaring their friend relationships on every site. This is especially true in web3 where each user's identity is already portable across sites.

With a decentralized social connection owned by users instead of platforms, each user is able to leave an app and join a new one without losing any connections or having to migrate everyone.

New social applications could all focus on creating and curating the best content and forget about rebuilding the wheels of a social connection database.

The **Social Connection** contains a DID's basic social connection information.

By standardizing connection information for DIDs, the Social Connection simplifies how applications can view and display the connections of their users.
