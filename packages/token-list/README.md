## Rationale

DataModel implementation of tokenlist

By standardizing tokenlist information for DIDs, the Basic Profile simplifies how applications can view and display the profiles of their users.

Token Lists is a community-led initiative to improve discoverability, reputation and trust in ERC20 token lists in a manner that is inclusive, transparent, and decentralized.

**DID-agnostic support:** Since Ceramic documents can be created and controlled by any DID, the Basic Profile can be used in conjunction with any DID method.
