# Address Book DataModel

DataModel implementation of the **Address Book**  and **DIDToAddressBook** schemas as first outlined in this [Gitcoin Grant](https://gitcoin.co/issue/28896).

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D @datamodels/address-book
```

## Rationale

Allow users to create an address book to manage different accounts they are working with across EVM chains. Have a data model that is consistent and be available for other applications to utilize. The first implementation was completed on the [Superfluid Console](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-console) application

## Schemas

### [AddressBook](./schemas/AddressBook.json)

## [DIDToAddressBook](./schemas/DIDToAddressBook.json)
